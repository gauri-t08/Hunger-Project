Visualization of the data is done, to understand the dataset in detail. Graphs like bargarph, line graphs plotted across various  dimensions to dig out any hidden patterns and relationships. Pair plot to understand the correlation among all the features with each other.

# draft_#2_cluster.ipynb
Created clusters to divide the data set based on centre_ids

# draft_#3_Reg_result.ipynb
Performed One-Hot encoding on the categorical variable. Data is then split into TEST & TRAIN followed by Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Bagging (Random Forest) and lastly Gradient Descent Boosting, XGBoost for comparing the model accuracy for data set.
